# image-resizer
version 1 makes all uploaded images twice smaller, gif encoding done wrong, returns a static image.
version 2 resizes all input images to 1000px height, gif encoding works incorrect, but program returns a gif file

main.go has to be run from console, index.html used to be run with live server (Go Live extension in VS Code)
